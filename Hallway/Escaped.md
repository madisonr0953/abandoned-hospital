   YOU ESCAPED?  
  Lucky for you, the vent was the right way to go it led right outside to where you were able to get help from close by people. You were taken to a different hospital 20 minuts away, the nurses treated you and you were laying in bed. 
  you decided to take a nap after your long tiring journey but you still had the feeling that something was off, that something was watching you... did you really escape? :).   
    Wanna set on a different path?
